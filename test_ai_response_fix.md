# AI Response Fix Test

## Issue
After implementing context injection on every turn, AI responses were not being displayed.

## Root Cause
The system message was being injected AFTER the AI call instead of BEFORE:

**Old Flow (Broken)**:
1. Add user message to history
2. Call AI with history (missing system message!)
3. Get AI response
4. Add assistant response to history
5. Inject/update system message ❌ TOO LATE!

**New Flow (Fixed)**:
1. Add user message to history
2. **Inject/update system message with current context** ✓
3. Call AI with complete history (including system message)
4. Get AI response
5. Add assistant response to history

## Changes Made

### File: `backend/app/services/conversation_service.py`

1. **Line 537-539**: Added system message injection BEFORE AI call
   ```python
   # Inject/update system message with current context BEFORE calling AI
   logger.info("Injecting/updating system message with current context")
   self._inject_or_update_system_message(codebase_content, agent_prompt)
   ```

2. **Lines 1248-1295**: Created new method `_inject_or_update_system_message()`
   - Builds system message with current context
   - Checks if system message exists at position 0
   - Either updates existing or inserts new system message
   - Called BEFORE AI processing

3. **Lines 1297-1306**: Simplified `_update_conversation_history()`
   - Now only appends assistant response
   - System message injection moved to separate method called earlier

## Test Steps

1. Start the backend (should auto-reload)
2. Open the frontend
3. Select some context files
4. Send a message to the AI
5. **Verify**: AI response appears in the chat

## Expected Result
- AI responses should appear normally
- System message is injected with current context before each AI call
- Context updates (adding/removing files) will be reflected in the next AI call
