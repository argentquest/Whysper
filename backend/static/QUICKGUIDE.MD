# Whysper: Quick Start Guide

Welcome to Whysper, your AI-powered pair programmer! This guide will walk you through the essential features and help you get the most out of the application.

## Getting Started

Whysper is designed to help you understand and work with your codebase more effectively. You can ask questions about your code, generate documentation, and much more.

## Core Features

### Chatting with Your Codebase

To start a conversation, simply type your question in the chat input box and press **Enter** or click the **Send** button. The AI will respond with an answer based on the context you've provided.

### Setting the Context

The **Set Context** feature is crucial for getting accurate and relevant answers from the AI. By setting the context, you are telling the AI which files and directories it should focus on when answering your questions.

**How to Set Context:**

1.  **Select Files:** In the File Explorer, check the boxes next to the files and directories you want to include in the context.
2.  **Click "Set Context":** Once you have selected the desired files, click the **Set Context** button.

The AI will now have the information from these files available when you ask a question.

### Generating Documentation

Whysper can automatically generate documentation for your code. This is a powerful feature that can save you a lot of time.

**How to Generate Documentation:**

1.  **Set the Context:** Select the files you want to document using the File Explorer.
2.  **Click "Generate Document":** Click the **Generate Document** button.
3.  **Choose a Format:** Select the desired documentation format (e.g., Markdown, HTML).

Whysper will then generate the documentation and provide you with a downloadable file.

### Agents and Sub-Agents

Whysper uses a system of **Agents** and **Sub-Agents** to process your requests.

*   **Agent:** The main AI agent that you interact with. It is responsible for understanding your questions and coordinating the work of the Sub-Agents.
*   **Sub-Agents:** These are specialized AI agents that perform specific tasks, such as:
    *   Analyzing code
    *   Generating diagrams
    *   Creating documentation

This multi-agent system allows Whysper to handle complex requests and provide more accurate and detailed answers.
